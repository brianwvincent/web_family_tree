Prompt:
Create an artistic and symbolic image.

Use the following JSON structure as the source of truth for names and relationships:

{family_tree_json}

The image must include every "name" value from the JSON clearly and legibly within the composition — no names may be missing or obscured. Arrange them in a way that visually conveys their relationships (e.g., parent-child, siblings, descendants) according to the JSON structure.

Design & Clarity Requirements:

Each person’s name must appear exactly as written in the JSON, once per individual.

Use connecting lines, branches, or flow lines to illustrate family relationships.

Maintain readable text labels and clear hierarchy (ancestors above, descendants below).

Integrate the design and typography with the {theme} art style (colors, textures, atmosphere, motifs).

Keep the background cohesive and non-distracting so the family tree remains the focus.

Render at high resolution and with balanced composition.

Output goal:
A beautiful, themed family tree image that faithfully includes all given names and relationships from the JSON.


Theme: 
The image should convey a sense of legacy, connection, and time. Use the visual metaphor of a sprawling, ancient tree with glowing patterns on its bark, under a celestial sky. The style should be digital painting, epic, detailed, and magical.
